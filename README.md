[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) contact importer.  
A web app were you login with your RC account, give permission to modify 
your Google Contacts, and with just a few clicks you import the contacts
of whole batches.  

__Note:__ The code present on this app started as a 2-hour Monday hack,
so you might find several parts of it rather na√Øve or even wrong. Also,
this is part of my Node.js + Express.js + Jade + Passport.js learning,
so the quality of the code is somewhat low.

## Instalation
`npm install`

## Run
`npm start`
